\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a novel deep neural network model to fully utilize local and global information for top-$N$ recommendation in HIN. The model firstly learns user (item) embeddings according to the neighbor items (users) with a co-attention mechanism. In addition, our model learns relation representations between users and items to capture meta-path based interactions by optimizing a multi-label classification problem. Considering these two factors, an unified optimization objective is learned for top-$N$ recommendation. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the recommendation effectiveness of our model.
